# Advanced Custom Fields - Vimeo Field
Syncs up with the Vimeo OPEN API to give you a greater amount of flexibility than just using a text field.

This is a add-on field for the Advanced Custom Fields plugin. This field allows you to capture Vimeo API data from a single input field. You (or your clients) can enter in either the full Vimeo URL or just the Vimeo Video ID. In the admin, you’ll instantly be presented with the video so you can make sure you have linked up the correct one.

## Flexible 
The Vimeo Video field has 4 different return values: Embed, Video Object, Vimeo ID and Thumbnail Object. The Video Object pings the Vimeo API to get you specific information about the video like Title, Description, Number of Plays and more.

This is a great WordPress plugin for developers as it gives a quick start when clients ask to add videos and don’t exactly know how to do it. This way you can simply give them a field and almost no matter what they insert you’ll be able to grab the Vimeo ID to display on the frontend as the client needs it.

## Notes
It can only retrieve information from videos that are set to public or the on-demand section. Private videos are not accessible from the Vimeo Open API. This plugin works with Advanced Custom Fields version 4 and 5.

I am turning this over to the community to maintain. Enjoy!
